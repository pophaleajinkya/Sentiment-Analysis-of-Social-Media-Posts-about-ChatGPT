# Sentiment-Analysis-of-Social-Media-Posts-about-ChatGPT

ChatGPT is a new Generative AI tool made by OpenAI that helps computers understand and use human language better. Since its release, many people have been talking about it on social media. In this problem, you are asked to develop deep learning models to conduct sentiment analysis for each social media post about ChatGPT. By doing this, we can understand how people feel about this new technology.


The dataset consists of 219,200 social media posts about ChatGPT. Each post is labeled as either good, bad, or neutral. I have already cleaned the dataset for you, so that you can focus on the deep learning part.
